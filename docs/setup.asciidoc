== Setup

Download and install Java 1.7 or greater from https://java.com/en/download/; if
you're on a GNU/Linux distribution, install Java through your package manager.

After Java has been installed, make sure that the `java` command is available
in the system path by opening a terminal window and running `java -version`;
the command should display the version of Java installed on your system.

Download the Kibi binary distribution from http://siren.solutions/kibi and
extract it to a local directory.

To start the Elasticsearch cluster included in the distribution, open a
terminal window, change to the directory where you extracted Kibi and run
the following command:

[source,shell]
elastic/bin/elasticsearch

If you're on Windows, run the following command:

[source,shell]
elastic\bin\elasticsearch.bat

To start Kibi, open a second terminal window, change to the directory where you
extracted Kibi and run the following command:

[source,shell]
kibi/bin/kibi

If you're on Windows, run the following command:

[source,shell]
kibi\bin\kibi.bat

Upon first launch, the Windows firewall might display the following dialog
box; to allow the Kibi backend to connect to external datasources, please
check both check boxes (as shown below) and press the *Allow access* button.

Kibi can be accessed by visiting http://localhost:5602/; an overview of the
included demo dataset is available in <<getting-started, Getting started>>
section.

If you want to connect Kibi to a different Elasticsearch cluster, open
the configuration file in `kibi/config/kibi.yml`, set the correct URL in
the `elasticsearch_url` parameter, then restart Kibi.

=== Kibi and Elasticsearch Dynamic Mapping
By default, Elasticsearch enables  {elastic-ref}mapping-dynamic-mapping.html[dynamic mapping] for fields.
Kibi needs dynamic mapping to use fields in visualizations correctly, as well
as to manage the `.kibi` index where all its configuration is stored.

If your Elasticsearch use case requires you to disable dynamic mapping, you
need to manually provide mappings for fields that Kibi uses to create
visualizations.

You also need to manually enable dynamic mapping for the `.kibi` index.

The following procedure assumes that the `.kibi` index does not already exist
in Elasticsearch and that the `index.mapper.dynamic` setting in
`elasticsearch.yml` is set to `false`:

- Start Elasticsearch.

- Create the `.kibi` index with dynamic mapping enabled:

[source,shell]
curl -X PUT <your Elasticsearch URL>/.kibi -d '{ "index.mapper.dynamic": true }'

- Start Kibi, open the UI in your browser and verify that there are no
error messages related to dynamic mapping.
